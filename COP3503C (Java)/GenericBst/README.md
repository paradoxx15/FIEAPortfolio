# Generic Binary Search Tree
### by Gaelen Dignan

In this assignment I was tasked with implementing a binary search tree that uses generics so that it can hold any kind of Comparable object.

File Descriptions:
- GenericBST.java is my own coded solution to this assignment.
- TestCase01.java is a sample main function that tests my solution, Designed by Sean Szumlanski.
- TestCase01-output.txt shows what the desired output is. Can use to check my solution is correct if need be.
- GenericBST.pdf is the assignment document and contains additional information about the assignment.

Major Features:
- Redesigned BST with generics
- Insertion, deletion, contains, and finding the max
- Preorder, inorder, and postorder printing

How to run:
- javac GenericBST.java TestCase01.java
- java TestCase01
