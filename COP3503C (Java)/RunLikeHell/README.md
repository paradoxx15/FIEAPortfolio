# Run Like Hell
### by Gaelen Dignan

In this assignment I was tasked with implementing a dynamic programming solution to a problem where given an array of positive integers we must return the max sum of numbers we can grab. When grabbing a number means we cannot grab the next number in the array but have to skip it.

File Descriptions:
- RunLikeHell.java is my own coded solution to this assignment.
- TestCase.java are sample main functions that test my solution, Designed by Sean Szumlanski.
- TestCase-output.txt shows what the desired output is. Can use to check my solution is correct if need be.
- RunLikeHell.pdf is the assignment document and contains additional information about the assignment.

Major Features:
- Shows a Dynamic Programming Solution

How to run:
- javac RunLikeHell.java TestCaseX.java
    - Replace X with whichever test case you are trying to run
- java TestCaseX
- To run all test cases at once
    - ./test-all.sh
