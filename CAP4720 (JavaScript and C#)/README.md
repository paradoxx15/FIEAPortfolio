# Solutions to Assignments from CAP4720 UCF
### by Gaelen Dignan

This directory contains four game projects built for the web using Javascript's THREE.js library. Additionally, it contains a demo for a Unity project I built for my final project within this class. This demo is the base version of the game, and has since been heavily expanded on, but is currently not readily available for demo. Additionally I went onto taking the graduate level version of this class where I worked strictly with lighting computation and shaders.

In order to run any of the Javascript projects just run the `index.html` on Microsoft Edge. Use Microsoft Edge because without running a local server Google Chrome has restrictions that cause the projects not to run.
