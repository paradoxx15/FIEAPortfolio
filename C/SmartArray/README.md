# Smart Array
### by Gaelen Dignan

In this assignment I was tasked with implementing a smart array that dealt with various problems programmers often encounter with arrays in C. 

Major Features:
- Creation and Destruction of the dynamic data structure.
- Expansion of the smart array based on contained data.
- Trimming the smart array when its capacity is greater than current size.
- Inserting, retreaving, setting, and removing elements dynamically.

How to run:
- gcc SmartArray.c sample-main1.c
    - Replace sample-main1.c with any main you would like to test
- ./a.out

For More information check out the SmartArray.pdf, which is the assignment document.
