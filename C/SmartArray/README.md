# Smart Array
### by Gaelen Dignan

In this assignment I was tasked with implementing a smart array that dealt with various problems programmers often encounter with arrays in C.

File Descriptions:
- SmartArray.c is my own coded solution to this assignment.
- sample-main.c are sample main functions that test my solution in multiple ways. Designed by Sean Szumlanski.
- sample-output.txt show what the desired output is. Can use to check my solution is correct if need be.
- SmartArray.pdf is the assignment document and contains additional information about the assignment.

Major Features:
- Creation and Destruction of the dynamic data structure.
- Expansion of the smart array based on contained data.
- Trimming the smart array when its capacity is greater than current size.
- Inserting, retreaving, setting, and removing elements dynamically.

How to run:
- gcc SmartArray.c sample-main1.c
    - Replace sample-main1.c with any main you would like to test
- ./a.out
